# YT's Musical Chairs

Have you ever spontaneously wanted to play musical  chairs but didn't have anyone to play it with? Well have I got the app for you. Introducing YT's Musical Chairs. Just plugin a video and the video will stop and start at random times. 

The time-stops progressively become shorter the closer it is to the max iterations (default 30). When max iterations have been reached, the game just stops stopping (to be changed someday probably).
